Most people already know that I write in mirror image (I was a big Leonardo da Vinci fan when I was 8, couldn't be helped) but I'm sure I can come up with one or two more.  When I graduated high school and they asked me for a biography, i forgot to remove a joke I'd put in about wanting to be a shark when I grew up so out loud, in front of a large auditorium of people, it was annouced that I'd decided to major in shark.  It's the kind of mistake that could happen to the best of us. I'm also a large fan of cookie dough (but who isn't) and I carried all my luggage up the Eiffel tower one time by accident. Long day.</p>
